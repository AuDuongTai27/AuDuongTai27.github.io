# Dual-Mode Personal Portfolio

A comprehensive portfolio website featuring a unique **Gateway Interface** that allows visitors to choose between two distinct viewing experiences: **Creative (Interactive)** and **Professional (Formal)**.

This project merges high-end visual animations with professional structure to showcase both technical skills and career history.

## 🚀 Tech Stack & Libraries

This portfolio is built using standard web technologies enhanced by powerful animation libraries:

* **HTML5**: Semantic structure for the website.
* **CSS3**: Flexbox for layout, custom animations, and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Logic for navigation, active states, and DOM manipulation.
* **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: The core engine used for high-performance animations (Creative Mode).
* **GSAP ScrollTrigger**: Used for the "Zoom-through-window" effect and Horizontal Scrolling.
* **Font Awesome**: Used for icons.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Gateway Split-Screen**: An entry page letting users select their preferred viewing mode.
* **Mode Switching**: Seamlessly toggle between "Creative" and "Formal" modes from any page.
* **Immersive Intro (Creative)**: Scroll-triggered zoom effect transitioning from a video background.
* **Horizontal Scrolling (Creative)**: A unique layout for Projects and Contact sections.
* **Clean Layout (Formal)**: A structured, easy-to-read format optimized for recruiters.
