# Creative Personal Portfolio

A modern, interactive one-page portfolio website designed to showcase projects and skills. This project features advanced scrolling animations, a unique horizontal layout, and immersive visual effects using GSAP.

## 🚀 Tech Stack & Libraries

This portfolio is built using standard web technologies enhanced by powerful animation libraries:

* **HTML5**: Semantic structure for the website.
* **CSS3**: Flexbox for layout, custom animations, and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Logic for navigation, active states, and DOM manipulation.
* **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: The core engine used for high-performance animations.
* **GSAP ScrollTrigger**: A specific plugin used to create the "Zoom-through-window" effect and the Horizontal Scrolling experience.
* **Font Awesome**: Used for icons.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Immersive Intro**: Scroll-triggered zoom effect that transitions from a video background through a window.
* **Horizontal Scrolling**: A seamless transition from vertical scrolling to a horizontal slide for the **Projects** and **Contact** sections.
* **Active Navigation**: The menu automatically highlights, changes color (Neon Cyan), and scales up based on the current section.
* **Smooth UX**: Optimized for a smooth scrolling experience.
